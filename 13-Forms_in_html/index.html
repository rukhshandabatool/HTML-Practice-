    <h4>What Is a Form in HTML?
    An HTML form is like a digital paper you give to your website visitors so they can fill in information like:
    <br />
    <ul>
       <li> Name </li>
    <br />
       <li> Email </li>
    <br />
       <li> Password </li>
    <br />
       <li> Message </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    * When we press Submit, the form sends the information somewhere to be processed (just like giving your paper to someone at the counter). </h4>
    <p> * Used to collect data from users.</p>

    <h5> syntax of FORM tag:-  <code>&lt;form&gt; </code> <code>&lt;/form&gt; </code></h5>


    <h2>Action in Form (defines what action is performed when the form is submitted)</h2>
    <p>This form will send the data to a backend file called <code>action.php</code>:</p>

    <h2> Form Tag & action attribute </h2>
    <p> In form:
        <form action="/action.php" method="POST"></form>
        action="/action.php" means:-
            ðŸ‘‰ When the form is submitted, it send the form data to a file called action.php for processing.
            <br /><br />
            method="POST" means:-
            ðŸ‘‰ Send the data securely and invisibly (not in the URL).
            <br /><br />
        So /action.php is a server-side file (usually written in PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.) that receives the data and does something with it, like saving it in a 
        database or sending an email.
     </p>

    <!-- Practicing of using form tag using action attribute -->
    <form action="/action.php">
        <h5>Enter your name:</h5>
        <input type="text" name ="Username" placeholder="Type your name here" required>
        <br /><br />

        <h5>Enter your email:</h5>
        <input type="email" name = "Email" placeholder="Type your email here">
        <br /><br />

        <h5>Enter your password:</h5>
        <input type="password" name = "User_password" placeholder="Enter your password">
        <br /><br />

        <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
    </form>

    <h5> âœ… Output: </h5>
    username = ABS
    <br/><br />
    email= example@gmail.com
    <br /><br />
    password=..........
    <br /><br />
    When submitted, this form sends to the /action.php file (your backend script).
    </p>
    
    <!-- In HTML, forms are used on websites to collect information from users â€” like names, emails, passwords, or messages.
         One of the most important parts of a form is the action attribute.
         The action defines where the form data should be sent after the user submits it. This is usually a backend server or file, such as a PHP file (action.php),
         Node.js route, or Python script.
         When the user clicks Submit, the form takes all the filled-in data and sends it to the specified backend location.
         At the backend, some action is performed â€” for example:
            * Saving the data to a database
            * Sending it via email
            * Logging it in a file
            * Triggering an API or message
        So basically, the HTML form collects data, and the backend (via action) processes that data.
        So, HTML forms collect data from users, and the action sends that data to a backend file or server to be processed.
